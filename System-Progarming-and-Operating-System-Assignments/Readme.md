# SPOS Assignments Repository

Welcome to the **SPOS Assignments** repository! This repository contains my completed assignments for the **System Programming and Operating Systems (SPOS)** course, showcasing practical skills and concepts learned during my academic journey. Each assignment is organized into its respective folder, containing all related files and resources.

All the assignments in this repository are part of my college coursework and demonstrate various techniques and methodologies in SPOS, including shell scripting, process management, and system-level programming.
